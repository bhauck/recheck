/**
 * General interface to filter changes during Diffing
 *
 * The Filter does not define positive or negative filtering, i.e. wether only matching elements are shown or only
 * elements that do not match.
 *
 * In principal, we create a diff for everything that differs, and put that into the result file. Then it is up to the
 * UI (GUI or CLI) to hide filtered differences – this is what this interface is for. This is pretty much inline with
 * how Git works – the diff is there, it just doesn't show up when filtered.
 *
 * Can be implemented by reading a file, or by an implementation delivered by the user.
